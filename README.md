## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the Web Forum Project, a Rails-based application designed to provide a user-friendly platform for engaging discussions. This forum allows users to sign up, create posts, comment on discussions, and much more.

## Features

User Authentication: Secure sign-in functionality with Devise for enhanced security.

CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete posts and comments, using intuitive interfaces for seamless navigation and content management. This forum also supports nested comments for enhanced user interaction.

User Profile: Manage display name and logout. Further, other users can also click on the author names in posts to view user profiles and the posts created by the same author.

Tags: Users can reuse or add new tags, as well as edit them later, to further personalise the posts. Further, users can search by tags by either clicking on the tag on allposts or individual post, or by going to Categories page and searching by one or more tags.

Favourites: Users can mark posts as favourite if they wish to view them later/ follow the post. They can remove it from favourites anytime
